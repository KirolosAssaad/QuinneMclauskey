Hello :)
To access the source code you will either find it attached to the blackboard assignment itself or in github using this link under the main branch: 
Please make sure that you have signed into your github account inorder to be able to open the link :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
to build the program please add the file called final_main.cpp to a solution in either visual studio or xcode in order to build and run it.
make sure to add your inputs with a file called "input.txt" which is saved under the same directory as the final_main.cpp
data inside the input.txt file must follow the same format as the assignment sheet.
only difference is that you must add '!' without the quotes after the last comma in the second and the thir line. 
i.e.:
4
3,4,5,!7
2,!10
this data corresponds to 4 variables, minterms are 3 and 4 and 5 and 7 and don't care terms are 2 and 10.
another i.e.
3
,!3
,!4
this data corresponds to 3 variables, minterm is 3, and don't care term is 4.
for more input examples: please check the test cases attached called input_1 and input_2 till input_10
